Before diving into <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, let's take a look at lower hanging fruit: animated television shows. Shows like Family Guy, the Simpsons, Archer, and Rick and Morty (used here) have a limited number of recurring characters, which reduces our workload to encode relationships. Another benefit is that people love making extensive wikis about these shows; this information can help you trace a character's appearance over one or multiple seasons. Last, the internet is abound with scripts that break episodes into specific scenes and use formatting that clearly identifies when a character speaks and to whom.

The files below show you my process of manually encoding <i>Rick and Morty</i> s01e01 ("Pilot").

rick-and-morty-nodes.csv provides a simple list of all named characters that appear in the episode with gender as an additional attribute. Each character has a unique id. This node file should be paired with rich-and-morty-pilot.csv, which lists the number of interactions between each character within each scene. I considered an interaction any instance a character spoke directly to another character or indirectly to a group of characters. The numbers in the Source and Target columns derive from the Id list in the node file.

rick-and-morty-new.csv aggregates the number of interactions between two characters across the entire episode as a weight (e.g., Morty -> speaks to -> Rick -> x number of times).
